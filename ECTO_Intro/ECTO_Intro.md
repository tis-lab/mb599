### Relevant information
ECTO is available in this GitHub repo: [https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/environmental-exposure-ontology](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/environmental-exposure-ontology) 

ECTO can be viewed in Protégé. 
- To download protege, go to: To download Protégé, go to: http://protege.stanford.edu/
- Instructions to clone a repository using the command line are available here.
- You can also install a graphical user interface like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Detailed instructions for downloading the repository in Sourcetree are [here](https://github.com/OHSUBD2K/BDK14-Ontologies-101/blob/master/docs/SourceTreeInstructions.md).
- A more detailed online Protege tutorial is available [here](http://ontology101tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

ECTO can be edited using [INCA forms](https://environmentontology.github.io/exposure-inca-form/?config=configurations%2Fenvironmental-exposure-ontology%2Fconfig.yaml&yaml=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FEnvironmentOntology%2Fenvironmental-exposure-ontology%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fpatterns%2Factivity.yaml). The GitHub repository for INCAforms is [here](https://github.com/INCATools/table-editor).

INCA forms utilize "dead simple ontology design patterns" (DOSDPs). More info about DOSDPs is available here: https://github.com/dosumis/dead_simple_owl_design_patterns

The design patterns for ECTO are available here: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/environmental-exposure-ontology/tree/master/src/patterns
